I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding, as we haven’t previously discussed a specific debugger for Elixir. However, I’ll assume you’re asking me to create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a state-of-the-art debugger for Elixir based on a fresh start. Below is a detailed and structured PRD tailored to this request, designed to meet the needs of Elixir developers debugging modern, concurrent, and distributed applications.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for ElixirDebugger

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the specifications for **ElixirDebugger**, a state-of-the-art debugger for the **Elixir programming language**. Elixir, built on the **Erlang Virtual Machine (VM)**, is renowned for its concurrency, scalability, and fault-tolerance features, making it a popular choice for building distributed and real-time applications. However, debugging such systems poses unique challenges due to their concurrent nature and live deployment requirements.

ElixirDebugger is designed to address these challenges by providing Elixir developers with a powerful, intuitive tool to debug applications efficiently. It will support debugging of concurrent processes, distributed systems, and live code updates, while integrating seamlessly with the Elixir ecosystem, including tools like **IEx (Interactive Elixir)**.

---

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of ElixirDebugger is to:

* Enable precise debugging of Elixir applications with a focus on **concurrency and distribution**.
* Provide **real-time insights** into process states, variable values, and system behavior.
* Allow debugging of **live, running systems** without interrupting service.
* Enhance developer productivity through an intuitive interface and seamless workflow integration.

---

## 3. Scope

The initial release of ElixirDebugger will focus on core debugging capabilities tailored to Elixir’s unique features. Below is an outline of what’s included and excluded:

**Included:**

* Debugging of individual Elixir processes.
* Support for distributed debugging across multiple nodes.
* Live code reloading during debugging sessions.
* Breakpoints, stepping, and variable inspection.
* Interactive expression evaluation.
* Integration with IEx and a graphical user interface (GUI).

**Excluded (for Initial Release):**

* Built-in performance profiling tools.
* Support for debugging Native Implemented Functions (NIFs).
* Integration with external observability tools (e.g., telemetry systems).

Future versions may expand these capabilities based on user needs.

    * Support conditional breakpoints based on process state or variable values.

### 4.5 Stepping

* **Description:** Step through code execution with granular control.
* **Details:**
    * Step into functions, step over them, or step out to the calling function.
    * Navigate through concurrent process execution flows.

### 4.6 Variable Inspection

* **Description:** Inspect variable values and process state during debugging.
* **Details:**
    * Display current variable bindings in the scope, respecting Elixir’s immutability.
    * Show process-specific state (e.g., GenServer state).

### 4.7 Expression Evaluation

* **Description:** Evaluate Elixir expressions in the debugging context.
* **Details:**
    * Execute expressions using the current process state and bindings.
    * Provide immediate feedback within the debugging session.

### 4.8 Integration with IEx

* **Description:** Offer an interactive shell experience similar to IEx.
* **Details:**
    * Allow command execution and expression evaluation during debugging.
    * Mirror IEx’s usability for familiarity.

### 4.9 Visual Interface

* **Description:** Provide a graphical interface for enhanced usability.
* **Details:**
    * Visualize processes, call stacks, and variable values.
    * Display a process tree for distributed systems.

### 4.10 Macro Support

* **Description:** Debug Elixir macros effectively.
* **Details:**
    * Show expanded macro code during debugging.
    * Allow stepping through macro-generated code if needed.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance

* The debugger must minimize overhead on the application’s runtime performance.
* Debugging operations (e.g., stepping, inspection) should execute with low latency.

### 5.2 Usability

* The interface (CLI and GUI) must be intuitive, with clear documentation.
* Error messages should be descriptive and actionable.

### 5.3 Compatibility

* Support the latest versions of Elixir and Erlang/OTP.
* Ensure compatibility with popular frameworks like Phoenix.

### 5.4 Reliability

* Handle edge cases like network failures in distributed debugging gracefully.
* Maintain stability during live code reloading.

## 6. User Stories

Below are example scenarios illustrating how developers will use ElixirDebugger:

* **Story 1:** "As a developer, I want to attach to a misbehaving process in my Elixir app so I can inspect its state and fix the issue."
* **Story 2:** "As a developer, I want to debug a distributed system across three nodes to identify a communication bug."
* **Story 3:** "As a developer, I want to update code in a live system and continue debugging to test my changes."
* **Story 4:** "As a developer, I want to set a breakpoint and step through my code to trace a logic error."
* **Story 5:** "As a developer, I want to evaluate an expression mid-debugging to confirm my assumptions."

## 7. User Interface

### 7.1 Command-Line Interface (CLI)

* Integrated with IEx for a familiar experience.
* **Commands include:**
    * `attach <pid>`: Attach to a process.
