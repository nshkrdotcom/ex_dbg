Looking at the provided code, I can see that we have two distinct but complementary systems:

1. **Tidewave** - A Phoenix-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI-assisted development tools
2. **ex_dbg** - A comprehensive Elixir debugging and observability framework (from the paste.txt document)

Let me analyze how to best integrate these systems to create a powerful AI-assisted debugging experience.

## Key Recommendations

Based on my analysis, here's how to best integrate Tidewave with ex_dbg:

### 1. **Hybrid Integration Approach** 
Rather than reimplementing ex_dbg from scratch, integrate it as **MCP tools within Tidewave's existing ecosystem**. This leverages Tidewave's mature infrastructure while adding ex_dbg's deep debugging capabilities.

### 2. **Complementary Strengths**
- **Tidewave**: Excellent MCP protocol implementation, Phoenix integration, AI-ready architecture
- **ex_dbg**: Deep BEAM introspection, time-travel debugging, comprehensive trace storage

### 3. **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1**: Add ex_dbg functionality as new Tidewave MCP tools
```elixir
# New tools like:
- start_tracing
- get_state_timeline  
- analyze_state_changes
- trace_process_events
```

**Phase 2**: Create enhanced tools that combine both systems
```elixir
# Advanced scenarios like:
- debug_liveview_issue (LiveView discovery + ex_dbg tracing)
- analyze_performance_bottleneck
- debug_genserver_crash
```

### 4. **Technical Benefits**
- ✅ No MCP protocol duplication
- ✅ Immediate AI integration through existing Tidewave architecture  
- ✅ Incremental implementation and testing
- ✅ Unified interface for all debugging needs

### 5. **User Experience**
Users get natural language debugging with queries like:
- "Why did my GenServer crash?" → AI analyzes ex_dbg trace data
- "Show me the state changes for this LiveView" → Combined LiveView + state tracing
- "What messages are being exchanged between these processes?" → ex_dbg message flow analysis

This approach maximizes the value of both systems while minimizing development complexity and avoiding the need to reimplement either system's core functionality.
