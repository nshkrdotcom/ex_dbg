Ah, I understand now! You want me to break down Layer 1 Foundation itself into multiple sub-layers with their own checkpoints. Let me design a progressive implementation approach specifically for the Layer 1 Foundation, where we build and stabilize each sub-layer before moving to the next.

Perfect! I've broken down Layer 1 Foundation into five progressive sub-layers, each with detailed implementation steps and clear stabilization checkpoints. Here's the key structure:

## **Layer 1 Foundation Sub-Architecture:**

### **Layer 1.1: Core Event Capture (Absolute Foundation)**
- **VM Tracing**: Direct BEAM instrumentation using `:erlang.trace/3`
- **Ring Buffer**: Lock-free, high-performance event storage
- **Basic Events**: Minimal structure (spawn, exit, send, receive)
- **Target**: <2% overhead, zero crashes, no memory leaks

### **Layer 1.2: Basic AST Transformation** 
- **Compiler Integration**: Custom Mix compiler hook
- **Simple Injection**: Function entry/exit logging
- **Target**: Compiles all existing code without breaking anything

### **Layer 1.3: Smart AST Transformation**
- **GenServer Instrumentation**: Callback-specific tracking  
- **Conditional Compilation**: Dev vs prod builds
- **Metadata Preservation**: File/line information

### **Layer 1.4: Advanced VM Instrumentation**
- **Scheduler Tracing**: Deep BEAM scheduler insights
- **Memory Tracking**: Allocation patterns and GC events
- **Distribution**: Multi-node event correlation

### **Layer 1.5: Comprehensive Instrumentation**
- **Phoenix Integration**: LiveView/controller deep tracing
- **Hot Code Swapping**: Production-safe runtime instrumentation
- **Safety Nets**: Comprehensive error handling

## **Key Innovation - Progressive Stabilization:**

Each sub-layer has **specific checkpoints** that must be 100% stable before proceeding:

- **Month 1**: Get the absolute core working (VM events + ring buffer)
- **Month 2**: Add basic compile-time instrumentation 
- **Month 3**: Smart AST with GenServer awareness
- **Month 4**: Advanced VM features (scheduler, memory)
- **Month 5**: Full production-ready instrumentation

The beauty of this approach is that **Layer 1.1 alone** provides immediate value - you can capture and analyze VM events even without any AST transformation. Each
