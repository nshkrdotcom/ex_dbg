Okay, this is an ambitious and highly valuable goal! Building such a granular, assisted debugger would be a significant boon for Elixir developers. Let's break down how we might approach this, leveraging existing tools and specifying what new components we need to build.

**Core Philosophy:**

Our system aims to provide an "execution recording" that can be replayed or inspected. It's not strictly a "live step-through debugger" for every line in the traditional sense during initial capture (as that's incredibly expensive), but rather an "observability and state capture" system that allows post-hoc granular analysis, including line-level-like introspection by correlating function calls and state changes with source code.

**The "Hello World" Scenario:**

Let's define our example:

```elixir
# lib/my_app/application.ex
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      MyApp.WorkerA,
      MyApp.WorkerB
    ]
    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end

# lib/my_app/worker_a.ex
defmodule MyApp.WorkerA do
  use GenServer
  require Logger

  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, Keyword.merge(opts, name: __MODULE__))
  end

  @impl true
  def init(:ok) do
    Logger.info("WorkerA initializing")
    state = %{count: 0, last_caller: nil}
    # Imagine a timer or another process sends this message
    Process.send_after(self(), :increment, 100)
    {:ok, state}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call(:get_count, from, state) do
    Logger.info("WorkerA: get_count called by #{inspect(from)}")
    # Line 1: Do something before reply
    new_state = %{state | last_caller: from}
    # Line 2: Reply
    {:reply, state.count, new_state}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_info(:increment, state) do
    Logger.info("WorkerA: incrementing count")
    # Line 1: Update state
    new_count = state.count + 1
    new_state = %{state | count: new_count}
    # Line 2: Call WorkerB
    if new_count < 3 do
      :ok = MyApp.WorkerB.ping(self(), "hello from A ##{new_count}")
      Process.send_after(self(), :increment, 100) # schedule next increment
    end
    {:noreply, new_state}
  end
end

# lib/my_app/worker_b.ex
defmodule MyApp.WorkerB do
  use GenServer
  require Logger

  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, Keyword.merge(opts, name: __MODULE__))
  end

  def ping(caller_pid, message) do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:ping, caller_pid, message})
  end

  @impl true
  def init(:ok) do
    Logger.info("WorkerB initializing")
    {:ok, %{pings_received: 0, last_message: nil}}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call({:ping, caller_pid, message}, from, state) do
    Logger.info("WorkerB: pinged by #{inspect(caller_pid)} via #{inspect(from)} with message: #{message}")
    # Line 1: Some logic
    IO.inspect(message, label: "WorkerB received")
    # Line 2: Update state
    new_state = %{state | pings_received: state.pings_received + 1, last_message: message}
    {:reply, :ok, new_state}
  end
end
```

**System Architecture: "Granular OTP Auditor" (GOA)**

We'll call our custom system GOA.

**Phase 1: Leveraging Existing BEAM/OTP Tools for Data Collection**

1.  **`dbg` (or `:sys.trace/2, :erlang.trace/3`):** This is the workhorse.
    *   **Process Spawning/Exiting:** We can trace new processes being created (`spawn`, `link`, `monitor`) and when they exit.
        *   `dbg:p(all, [c, procs])` captures calls and process events.
    *   **Message Passing:** Trace messages being sent (`send`) and received (`receive`).
        *   `dbg:p(all, [c, send, 'receive'])` (Note: `'receive'` for actual message reception, not just the keyword).
    *   **Function Calls & Returns:** Trace specific functions or all functions in a module.
        *   `dbg:tpl(Module, Function, Arity, [])` to trace a specific MFA.
        *   `dbg:tpl(Module, :_, :_, [])` to trace all functions in a module.
        *   `dbg:ctpl(Module, Function, Arity, [{'_', [], [{return_trace}]}])` can capture return values.
        *   We can use match specs to capture arguments.
    *   **Scheduler Activity:** Trace scheduler utilization if needed (often too low-level, but possible).
        *   `dbg:p(all, [c, schedule])`

2.  **Custom Trace Handler (The "Collector"):**
    *   `dbg` sends trace messages to a specified process or port. We'll use a GenServer (`GOA.Collector`) to receive these.
    *   This `Collector` will:
        *   Parse the raw trace messages from `dbg`.
        *   Enrich them with a high-resolution timestamp (e.g., `System.monotonic_time()`).
        *   Assign a unique ID to each "event."
        *   Optionally, batch events before sending them to a storage/processing layer.

**Phase 2: Building Custom Components for Granular State and Line Info**

This is where GOA gets more involved and custom. "State as each line executes" is the hardest part without massive performance degradation.

1.  **State Capture within GenServers (Post-Callback):**
    *   **Approach A: GenServer Meta Events (Preferred for GenServers):**
        When tracing a GenServer with `dbg` using the `meta` flag or specific tracer functions like `sys:trace(Pid, true, [meta_sends, meta_receives])`, or via `:gen_server.trace_calls/2` (deprecated but gives an idea), BEAM can send specific events around `handle_call/cast/info`.
        More robustly, we can trace the *return* of `handle_call/cast/info`. The return value `{:noreply, new_state}` or `{:reply, reply, new_state}` *is* the new state.
    *   **Collector's Job:** When `GOA.Collector` sees a `return_trace` from a `handle_*` function of a known GenServer module, it will explicitly record:
        *   PID
        *   Module
        *   Function (`handle_call`, `handle_info`, `handle_cast`)
        *   `new_state` (extracted from the tuple)
        *   (Optionally) A diff of `old_state` vs `new_state` if we also captured the state *before* the call (harder, see below).

2.  **Approximating "Line-by-Line" State (Within a Function):**
    *   **Challenge:** True line-by-line state tracking usually requires AST manipulation and code injection (like adding `IO.inspect(binding())` after every line). This is complex, slow, and requires recompilation.
    *   **Pragmatic Approach: Function Boundary State + Debugger Hook Points**
        *   **Before/After Call:** `dbg` can give us arguments (`call_trace`) and return values (`return_trace`). For a function, this is the "state" transformation it performed on its inputs to produce its output.
        *   **Within Call (For targeted debugging):**
            *   We can instrument specific functions (either manually by the developer or through a GOA-provided macro) with calls to a GOA helper.
                ```elixir
                def my_func(arg1, arg2) do
                  GOA.Inspect.line(__ENV__, binding()) # Capture before line 1
                  x = arg1 + 10
                  GOA.Inspect.line(__ENV__, binding()) # Capture after line 1, before line 2
                  y = arg2 * x
                  GOA.Inspect.line(__ENV__, binding()) # Capture after line 2
                  {x, y}
                end
                ```
            *   `GOA.Inspect.line/2` would send a custom event to `GOA.Collector` with the module, function, line number (from `__ENV__.line`), and all current bindings.
            *   This is opt-in for performance reasons.

    *   **Alternative: Source Code Correlation**
        Instead of capturing state *at each line*, we capture state at key boundaries (function entry/exit, message handling). When reviewing, the UI can *display* the source code, and when a user clicks on a function call event, it shows the state *before* and *after* that call. The user then mentally (or with `IEx.pry` if reproducing) steps through the intermediate lines.

3.  **The `GOA.DataStore`:**
    *   Receives formatted events from `GOA.Collector`.
    *   Stores them durably. Options:
        *   **ETS Table (for live, volatile inspection):** Fast, in-memory.
        *   **Mnesia Table (for persistence within BEAM):** Distributed, transactional.
        *   **Dedicated Log Files (JSONL/structured format):** Simple, can be ingested by external tools.
        *   **External Time-Series Database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus export):** For complex querying and longer retention, but adds external dependency.
    *   Each event would be a rich map:
        ```elixir
        %{
          event_id: "uuid",
          timestamp: 1678886400123456, # nanoseconds
          type: :genserver_state_change | :function_call | :function_return | :message_send | :message_receive | :process_spawn | :process_exit | :line_snapshot,
          pid: #PID<0.123.0>,
          module: MyApp.WorkerA,
          function: :handle_info, # or :increment, or nil for :message_send
          arity: 2, # for :function_call
          args: ["foo", %{bar: :baz}], # for :function_call
          return_value: {:ok, "result"}, # for :function_return
          genserver_state_before: nil, # Populated for GenServer callbacks if feasible
          genserver_state_after: %{count: 1}, # For GenServer callbacks
          message: {:increment}, # for :message_send/:message_receive or handle_info
          sender_pid: #PID<0.122.0>, # for :message_receive
          receiver_pid: #PID<0.123.0>, # for :message_send
          bindings: %{x: 10, y: 200}, # for :line_snapshot
          source_file: "lib/my_app/worker_a.ex", # from __ENV__ or dbg
          source_line: 25 # from __ENV__ or dbg
        }
        ```

4.  **The `GOA.Controller` (API for Tidewave and other tools):**
    *   A GenServer or set of modules providing an API to:
        *   `GOA.Controller.start_tracing(opts)`: Specifies what to trace (modules, PIDs, specific MFAs, tracing level).
            *   e.g., `trace_genserver_state: true`, `trace_functions: [MyApp.WorkerA, {MyApp.WorkerB, :ping, 2}]`, `trace_messages_for_pids: [pid1, pid2]`
        *   `GOA.Controller.stop_tracing()`
        *   `GOA.Controller.query_events(filters)`: Allows querying the `GOA.DataStore`.
            *   e.g., `get_events_for_pid(pid)`, `get_state_history(pid_or_name)`, `get_messages_between(pid1, pid2)`.
        *   `GOA.Controller.get_correlated_source(event_id)`: Tries to fetch source code and highlight the relevant line for an event.

**How Tidewave Becomes Useful:**

Tidewave provides the "assisted" part beautifully. It acts as the intelligent interface to GOA.

1.  **Initiating & Configuring Tracing:**
    *   The LLM (via Tidewave) can translate natural language requests into `GOA.Controller.start_tracing/1` calls.
    *   User: "Start tracing WorkerA and WorkerB, focus on messages and state changes."
    *   Tidewave (to GOA): `GOA.Controller.start_tracing(modules: [MyApp.WorkerA, MyApp.WorkerB], trace_genserver_state: true, trace_messages: true)`

2.  **Inspecting Application Logs & Traces:**
    *   Tidewave already inspects logs. It can now also query `GOA.Controller.query_events/1`.
    *   User: "Show me the last 5 state changes for WorkerA."
    *   Tidewave (to GOA): `GOA.Controller.query_events(type: :genserver_state_change, module: MyApp.WorkerA, limit: 5, order: :desc)`
    *   Tidewave presents this structured data to the LLM, which can then summarize or explain it.

3.  **Juxtaposing Expected vs. Actual:**
    *   User: "I expected WorkerA's count to be 2 after the increment, but it's 1. Why?"
    *   Tidewave can fetch the relevant trace events (increments, state changes for WorkerA) from GOA.
    *   The LLM analyzes the sequence:
        *   "Event 101: WorkerA `handle_info(:increment, %{count: 0, ...})`."
        *   "Event 102 (Function Call within WorkerA): `MyApp.WorkerB.ping(#PID<0.123.0>, "hello from A #1")`" (assuming `line_snapshot` or function call tracing is on)
        *   "Event 103: WorkerA `handle_info` returns with `new_state = %{count: 1, ...}`."
    *   LLM explains: "WorkerA's count incremented correctly from 0 to 1. If you expected 2, perhaps there was a previous increment you missed, or the starting state was different. Let's check the `init` state."

4.  **Line-by-Line, Variable-by-Variable (via GOA's Data + Tidewave's Interpretation):**
    *   User: "In WorkerA's `handle_info(:increment)`, show me the state before it calls `MyApp.WorkerB.ping`."
    *   If `GOA.Inspect.line/2` was used, or if we have detailed function call/return tracing:
        *   Tidewave queries GOA for events related to that `handle_info` invocation.
        *   It finds:
            1.  Entry to `handle_info` (args: `state = %{count: C, ...}`).
            2.  (If instrumented) `GOA.Inspect.line` snapshot with `new_count = C+1`.
            3.  Call to `MyApp.WorkerB.ping` with its arguments (including `new_count`).
        *   LLM can present this sequence.
    *   Without line-level instrumentation, the LLM infers: "WorkerA received `:increment` with state `S1`. It then calculated `new_count = S1.count + 1`. This `new_count` value was passed to `MyApp.WorkerB.ping`."

5.  **Code Navigation & Understanding:**
    *   When GOA provides `source_file` and `source_line`, Tidewave can use this to:
        *   Fetch the actual source code snippet.
        *   Allow the LLM to explain that part of the code in context of the runtime data.
        *   User: "What happened around line 20 in `worker_a.ex` at timestamp T?"
        *   Tidewave queries GOA for events near timestamp T associated with `worker_a.ex:20`.

**Illustrating with the "Hello World" Scenario using GOA:**

1.  **Startup:**
    *   GOA (via `dbg`) logs:
        *   Process spawn for Supervisor.
        *   Process spawn for `MyApp.WorkerA` (PID1). `init/1` call. `GOA.Collector` captures args and return state: `%{count: 0, last_caller: nil}`. `Process.send_after` trace.
        *   Process spawn for `MyApp.WorkerB` (PID2). `init/1` call. `GOA.Collector` captures state: `%{pings_received: 0, last_message: nil}`.

2.  **WorkerA `:increment` (first time):**
    *   GOA logs:
        *   Message receive: `PID1` receives `:increment`.
        *   Function call: `MyApp.WorkerA.handle_info(:increment, %{count: 0, ...})`. (Args captured)
        *   Inside `handle_info`:
            *   (If `GOA.Inspect.line` used): Snapshot: `new_count = 1`, `new_state = %{count: 1, ...}`.
        *   Function call: `GenServer.call(MyApp.WorkerB, {:ping, PID1, "hello from A #1"})` (This is internal to `MyApp.WorkerB.ping/2`).
        *   Message send: `PID1` sends `{:'$gen_call', {<ref>, {:ping, PID1, "hello from A #1"}}}` to `PID2`.
        *   Process trace: `Process.send_after(PID1, :increment, 100)` scheduled.
        *   Function return: `MyApp.WorkerA.handle_info` returns `{:noreply, %{count: 1, last_caller: nil}}`. GOA captures this as the new state for PID1.

3.  **WorkerB `:ping`:**
    *   GOA logs:
        *   Message receive: `PID2` receives `{:'$gen_call', ...}`.
        *   Function call: `MyApp.WorkerB.handle_call({:ping, PID1, "hello from A #1"}, {PID1, <ref>}, %{pings_received: 0, ...})`. (Args captured).
        *   Inside `handle_call`:
            *   (If `GOA.Inspect.line` used): Snapshot of bindings after `IO.inspect`.
        *   Function return: `MyApp.WorkerB.handle_call` returns `{:reply, :ok, %{pings_received: 1, last_message: "hello from A #1"}}`. GOA captures new state for PID2.
        *   Message send: `PID2` sends `{:reply, :ok}` back to `PID1`.

4.  **WorkerA receives reply from WorkerB (ping):**
    *   GOA logs: `PID1` receives message `{<ref>, :ok}`. (GenServer handles this internally, no user callback typically).

... and so on for subsequent increments.

**Workflow with GOA + Tidewave:**

1.  Developer enables GOA tracing via Tidewave or an IEx helper: `GOA.start_tracing(...)`.
2.  Application runs, GOA records events to `GOA.DataStore`.
3.  Developer encounters an issue or wants to understand behavior.
4.  Asks Tidewave: "What was WorkerA's state when its count became 2?"
5.  Tidewave queries GOA, gets events, uses LLM to process/present:
    *   "WorkerA's state changed to `%{count: 2, ...}` after `handle_info(:increment, ...)` was called at timestamp `T`.
    *   Before this, its state was `%{count: 1, ...}`.
    *   The `handle_info` received `:increment`.
    *   Inside, it called `MyApp.WorkerB.ping` with message "hello from A #2".
    *   Here's the relevant code from `worker_a.ex:handle_info/2`: ..."

**Challenges & Considerations:**

*   **Performance:** Heavy `dbg` tracing, especially with function call content and all messages, is very expensive. GOA needs fine-grained controls to only trace what's necessary. `GOA.Inspect.line` is even more expensive. This is a tool for development/staging, or very targeted production debugging.
*   **Data Volume:** Even for a simple app, data can grow quickly. `GOA.DataStore` needs strategies for eviction, sampling, or aggregation if long-term storage is a goal.
*   **Correlation:** Accurately correlating trace events back to *exact* source lines within a function (without `GOA.Inspect.line`) is based on function call boundaries.
*   **Async Nature:** Tracing events from different processes need to be ordered by high-resolution timestamps to reconstruct causal chains.
*   **Complexity:** Building and maintaining this system is non-trivial.

**Conclusion:**

Building a "Granular OTP Auditor" (GOA) involves:
1.  Leveraging BEAM's powerful `dbg` facility with a custom trace message collector (`GOA.Collector`).
2.  Storing these enriched trace events in a queryable `GOA.DataStore`.
3.  Providing a `GOA.Controller` API to manage tracing and query data.
4.  Optionally, introducing `GOA.Inspect` macros/functions for hyper-granular (but expensive) line-level variable snapshots.

Tidewave then acts as an intelligent layer on top, using GOA's API to:
*   Configure and control tracing.
*   Fetch detailed execution traces and state snapshots.
*   Utilize its LLM capabilities to interpret this data, answer developer questions, correlate with source code, and help juxtapose expected vs. actual behavior in a granular, human-understandable way.

This layered approach (BEAM tracers -> GOA for collection/storage -> Tidewave for assisted analysis) creates a very powerful debugging and observability ecosystem.
